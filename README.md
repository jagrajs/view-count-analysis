# MIT Course View Count Analysis

Ever notice how the view count on any YouTube MOOC (massive open online course) playlist falls with each lecture? No? Well I did and sought to visualize it! Using numerical analysis and data visualization with Python, I did just that!

Initially, I predicted that view count would fall linearly with each lecture. After collecting, cleaning, and visualizing YouTube MIT course playlist view count data, it's clear that that's not the case. It seems to drop exponentially, which is sad because that means most people who start watching an MIT course on YouTube quit watching after the first few lectures. In fact, I am guilty of this myself. However, with this knowledge, I'll see to it that I finish at least one course from start to finish and encourage you to do the same. Happy learning!
